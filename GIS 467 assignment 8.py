"""
Part 1: 
Create a script to generate a feature class displaying the areas served by each
    defibrillator on campus (from campus.gdb) using Thiessen Polygons.
Use the extent environment to extend the output to the edge of the extent of the 
    campus buildings (extent can be set to a feature class) 
For part 1, the arguments can be ‘hard-coded’
Submit the .py file

Part 2:
Create a copy of your script from part 1 and modify it to be a functioning 
    script tool (both a toolbox and .py component)
Script should take arguments (input defibrillators and buildings, output data, 
    and extent to use)
Submit both the .tbx and the .py file
Note: I should be able to run the script tool without modifying the script at 
    all to update paths
